this file contains a simple data which consists not only "alphabetical-characters" but also "Symbols",
and of course this file consists of 
several
lines
but my code can read until EOF.
And of course the this LISP code can distingush between CAPITAL LETTERS and small letters;

finally,
the output file which is called "huffman-output.txt" will contain every character in this file and
it's corresponding binary value (comperesed-value), sorted alphabetically.

my best regards,
